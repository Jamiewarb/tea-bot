I'm proud to release the first major version of tea bot!

* Take tea, coffee or other orders from everyone in the channel
* Ask politely if someone else will make tea/coffee
* Start a random round, where the person that will make the tea is picked randomly from everyone that wants one
* Store statistics each time you make drinks or have them made for you
* Ask the bot how many you've made for others, and how many you've drank from others
